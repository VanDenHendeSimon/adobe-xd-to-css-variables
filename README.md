# adobe-xd-to-css-variables
This Adobe XD Plugin will generate CSS variables for the saved Document Assets ( Colors, Font Families, Font Styles )
The colors will be grouped based on their saturation ( Greyscale vs Color ) and sorted based on their Lightness. This will influence the name given to the variable representing the color. This way, I was able to assign meaningful names.
